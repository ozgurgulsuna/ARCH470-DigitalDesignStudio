You are an intergalactic lonely man searching for the meaning of life through the worm-holes and blackholes. Each hole opens up a new time reality


, an alternate universe, a universe you could call your own. You step through the worm-hole, looking down at the green planet earth. You feel a shiver go up your spine, it is so beautiful here.


, so you have explored the universe in it's infinite forms.
------

some of the holes does not have an exit, its random chance

-----

You were born to a family of wealthy merchant traders on a planet in the Orion constellation known as New Terra.

You are an intergalactic lonely man exploring the parallel universes through worm-holes and blackholes. There are gravity zones which affect your time reality  in this multi-dimensional universe
There are anti-grav zones, which you need to be very careful in, since matter and time dangle around them like a fisherman's worm on a hook.
Its a hard to orient yourself in this turbulent hurricane like environment. The universe itself is bending and warping in ways that are difficult to comprehend.
------


You really want to return to your own universe, but you can't seem to find your way back...
You don't know what will become of you in this maze of worm-hole and blackhole.

You don't know what will become of you in this maze of worm-hole and blackhole.
gravitational fields are so strong here that your spaceship brokes and swirls into a blackhole. After a few hours of spinning, your ship is ripped from your hands, as space time pulls it into the center of the black hole.
you dont know what to find there 
There are several universes where you have been and continue to be, but they are all very strange. You are an outcast from your own universe for being a lone traveler from another universe.

at one point this specific universe seem very familiar. It is like you have been here before, in the depth of your hearth. At that moment you realize these universes are single universe but in different time frames.
You don't remember when you have been here before, and you can't remember if you have traveled to this universe or not. However, you do know that you can't be here now, that is for sure.
